DeepLink Research Group @Shanghai AI Lab
==============================================

We enhance the performance and efficiency of machine learning systems!

The Network and Distributed Systems (NDS) Group at the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, led by Dr. Peng Sun, specializes in developing efficient systems and architectures for deep learning model training and deployment. We create both internal and open-sourced systems to efficiently train large language models and multimodal models on thousands of AI chips.

Our research has been recognized at leading conferences such as OSDI, NSDI and ASPLOS , highlighting our commitment to innovation. We received the Best Paper Award at ASPLOS 2024 and the Distinguished Paper Award at ASPLOS 2023.

The NDS Group operates under the Center of AI Training and Computation (CAIF), led by Prof. Dahua Lin and Xingcheng Zhang.

We are always seeking passionate individuals, including full-time research engineers and interns, to join our team. If you are interested in contributing to cutting-edge research in machine learning systems, please reach out to us at sunpeng@pjlab.org.cn.

联合培养博士项目
